# Bluetooth Direction-Finding IQ Dataset

This repository hosts the **raw and pre-processed in-phase/quadrature (IQ) samples** collected for the paper *“A 12-Antenna Rectangular Array Dataset for Bluetooth Direction Finding”* (submitted to IEEE Access, 2025).  
The data were captured with Nordic **nRF52833-DK** boards acting as tag and anchor and are intended for research on **Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)** estimation and indoor positioning.

> **TL;DR** – clone the repo, download the release asset `ble_aoa_dataset_v1.0.zip`, unzip, and follow the quick-start notebook in [`code/`](code/).

## 1. Folder hierarchy


- **Grid:** *n* discrete positions laid out on an orthogonal grid; each position contains 10 raw text files.  
- **Circular (circumference):** one folder per **radius**; each radius contains sub-folders labelled `X_deg` where `X` is the azimuth angle; every angle folder stores 10 raw logs.

## 2. Raw file format

Each `file_XX.txt` is a plain UTF-8 log generated by the firmware running on the nRF52833 receiver.  
Lines beginning with `IQ:` encode a single complex sample:


Lines injected by the debug firmware (timestamps, status words, etc.) were **removed** during the preprocessing step detailed in Section 3.
